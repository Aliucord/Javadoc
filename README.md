# Javadoc

This repo holds Aliucord's Javadoc. It is hosted using github pages and can be found over at https://aliucord.github.io/Javadoc

We automatically generate and update the javadoc with [a github workflow](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-javadoc.yml). 
Thus, issues and pull requests should be made in the [Aliucord repo](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord) and NOT here.
